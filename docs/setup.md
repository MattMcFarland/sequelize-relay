# Setup

This Chapter will guide users through setting up a blank package with nodejs.  We'll cover installing dependencies, installing Express JS, installing graphql, etc.  We'll end this chapter with a confirmed hello world and wide eyes....

1. Setup a new npm project
2. Run `npm install graphql graphql-relay sequelize sequelize-relay --save-dev`

Of course, this is WIP.  I hope to finish this within the next week.
