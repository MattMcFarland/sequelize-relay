This section will cover the usage of graphql-relay-js in regards to adding nodes, edges, etc.  It will explain the base64 stuff as well as share information regarding relay specification.  

This section will also cover some of the babel transforms that create graphql schema files etc.

This will end with the ability to do all of the basic things needed in the specification so we can finally connect a react app.
